        <ul>
            <li>Pre 2018 : Alphie always thought that music was his one single passion and only career path. He worked really hard, he flew many many miles to United States from his home in Malaysia to attend grad school and then worked towards a doctoral
                degree in music.
            </li>
            <li>Aug 2018 : After completing his coursework and candidacy exams for his doctorate in music degree, Alphie decided to move to St. Louis to make a life for himself and his partner.</li>
            <li>Jan 2019 : Tired of working five jobs as a musician, with income fluctuating constantly, Alphie decides to look into some a change in career. </li>
            <li>Mar 2019 : A close friend who is a software engineer says, "try learning to code!". Alphie heeds friend's advice, thus embarking on <b>This Journey.</b></li>
            <li>Mar 2019 : Started googling "What is Coding? What does it taking to be a computer programmer?...etc".</li>
            <li>Mar 2019 : Started learning basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.org</a>, and <a href="https://www.lynda.com" target="_blank">Lynda.com</a></li>
            <li>June 2019: Same friend mentioned that <a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode.org</a> will be starting a new LC101 course in August. Alphie applied. The application assessment was pretty challenging. Alphie was feeling
                quite deflated after the test.</li>
            <li>Aug 2019 : Lady Luck must have been with Alphie as it turned out he was accepted to the LC101 program. Two months in, he is feeling a bit more confident with his coding skills. Though he is far from learning all he needs to learn, he types
                away at the keyboard with perseverence and thinks "perhaps I might have a career as a programmer afterall?".</li>
        </ul>
